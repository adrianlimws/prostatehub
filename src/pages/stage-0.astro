            <p>The prostate is a gland about the size of a walnut. It is situated just below the bladder and
              surround the neck of the bladder and the top part of the urethra (tube from the bladder that
              empties the urine). The prostate also contributes to the seminal fluid produced during ejaculation
              and has an important function in fertility.</p>

          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p>When diagnosed, prostate cancer is categorized into risk groups based on how likely it is to grow or spread:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Low risk (19% of cases):</strong> Cancer that is least likely to grow or spread</li>
              <li><strong>Intermediate risk (44% of cases):</strong> Mid-range likelihood of growing or spreading</li>
              <li><strong>High risk (26% of cases):</strong> Higher likelihood of growing or spreading</li>
              <li><strong>Regional (8% of cases):</strong> Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or surrounding areas</li>
              <li><strong>Metastatic (3% of cases):</strong> Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body</li>

            <p>While there's no guaranteed way to prevent prostate cancer, certain lifestyle choices may help reduce your risk:</p>

              <li>Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>

              <li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
              <li>Know your family history - men with close relatives who have had prostate cancer are at higher risk</li>

        <Accordion title="When to Start Screening">
          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p>The Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test is a blood test that can help detect prostate cancer early.</p>
            <p>Consider talking to your doctor about prostate screening if:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>You are over 50 years old</li>
              <li>You have a family history of prostate cancer (consider starting at 40-45)</li>
              <li>You are of African or Caribbean descent (these groups have higher risk)</li>
              <li>You have certain genetic predispositions (discuss with your doctor)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PSA levels are typically measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. Normal ranges vary by age, but generally:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Under 4.0 ng/mL is considered normal</li>
              <li>Between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL suggests possible prostate concerns</li>
              <li>Over 10.0 ng/mL indicates higher risk of prostate cancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember that PSA levels can be affected by factors other than cancer, so discuss results with your healthcare provider.</p>
