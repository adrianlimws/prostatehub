              empties the urine). The prostate also contributes to the seminal fluid produced during ejaculation

            <p>The Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test is a blood test that can help detect prostate cancer early.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>You are over 50 years old</li>
              <li>You have a family history of prostate cancer (consider starting at 40-45)</li>
              <li>You are of African or Caribbean descent (these groups have higher risk)</li>
              <li>You have certain genetic predispositions (discuss with your doctor)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PSA levels are typically measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. Normal ranges vary by age, but generally:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Under 4.0 ng/mL is considered normal</li>
              <li>Between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL suggests possible prostate concerns</li>
              <li>Over 10.0 ng/mL indicates higher risk of prostate cancer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Cultural Context and Risk Factors</h3>
            <p>Māori men face higher rates of prostate cancer mortality compared to non-Māori men in New Zealand. Research shows that while incidence rates are similar, Māori men are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage when the disease is more difficult to treat.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Key Facts for Māori Men</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Māori men are 70% more likely to die from prostate cancer after diagnosis compared to non-Māori men</li>
              <li>Access to screening services can be challenging for those in rural communities</li>
              <li>Early detection significantly improves outcomes for all men, including Māori</li>
              <li>Family history (whakapapa) is an important risk factor to consider</li>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Cultural Approaches to Health</h3>
            <p>Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori health model that views health as a balance of four dimensions:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Taha tinana (physical health)</strong> - Regular check-ups and healthy lifestyle choices</li>
              <li><strong>Taha wairua (spiritual health)</strong> - Connection to identity and spiritual wellbeing</li>
              <li><strong>Taha whānau (family health)</strong> - Support from and obligations to whānau</li>
              <li><strong>Taha hinengaro (mental health)</strong> - Expressing thoughts and feelings about health concerns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This holistic approach can be integrated with Western medical care for better outcomes.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Māori-Focused Health Services</h3>
            <p>Several organizations offer culturally responsive services for Māori men:</p>
