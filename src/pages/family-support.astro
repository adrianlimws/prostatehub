            <h3 class="font-semibold">How can I best support my loved one emotionally?</h3>
            <p>Being present, listening without judgment, and acknowledging their feelings are powerful ways to provide emotional support. Sometimes simply sitting with them in silence is enough.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">How do I talk to children about prostate cancer?</h3>
            <p>Use age-appropriate language, be honest but hopeful, and reassure them that no one is to blame. The Cancer Society offers resources specifically for talking to children about cancer.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">What if I feel overwhelmed?</h3>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">How can we maintain intimacy during treatment?</h3>
            <p>Open communication about needs and expectations is essential. Remember that intimacy encompasses more than sexual activity—emotional closeness, touch, and quality time together are all important aspects of intimacy.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">How do I balance caregiving with my own needs?</h3>
            <p>Setting boundaries, accepting help from others, and scheduling regular breaks are crucial. Remember that taking care of yourself enables you to provide better support to your loved one.</p>
