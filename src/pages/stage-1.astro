          <div class="space-y-4 font-serif">
            <p>Stage 1 prostate cancer means the cancer is small and contained entirely within the prostate. At this stage:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>The cancer cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam</li>
              <li>The cancer is microscopic and only found through a biopsy</li>
              <li>PSA levels are usually below 10 ng/mL</li>
              <li>The Gleason score is typically 6 or lower</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stage 1 prostate cancer is part of the "low-risk" category and has an excellent prognosis in New Zealand, with many treatment options available.</p>
            <p>In New Zealand, most Stage 1 prostate cancers are detected through PSA blood tests, followed by either transperineal or transrectal biopsies. Transperineal biopsy (where the needle passes through the skin between the scrotum and rectum) is now the preferred method in New Zealand due to lower risk of complications.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Understanding Stage 1 Diagnosis for Māori Men</h3>
            <p>Being diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer can be a challenging time for Māori men and their whānau. At this stage, the cancer is confined to the prostate and is generally considered highly treatable. However, research shows that Māori men are less likely to be diagnosed at this early stage compared to non-Māori.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Treatment Considerations</h3>
            <p>When considering treatment options for Stage 1 prostate cancer, Māori men may wish to incorporate traditional healing approaches alongside Western medical treatments:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Discussing treatment impacts on all aspects of hauora (wellbeing) with your healthcare team</li>
              <li>Considering how treatments might affect your role within whānau and community</li>
              <li>Understanding the balance between immediate treatment and active surveillance</li>
              <li>Exploring how rongoā Māori (traditional medicine) might complement medical treatments</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Cultural Support During Treatment</h3>
            <p>The concept of manaakitanga (showing respect and care) is important during cancer treatment. Ways to incorporate cultural support include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Bringing whānau members to appointments for support and to help understand medical information</li>
              <li>Requesting a Māori health navigator through your DHB or cancer treatment center</li>
              <li>Asking for cultural support or access to a kaumātua (elder) at your treatment facility</li>
              <li>Discussing with your doctor how treatment schedules can accommodate cultural obligations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Addressing Barriers to Care</h3>
            <p>Some barriers that Māori men might face when dealing with Stage 1 prostate cancer include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Geographic distance from treatment centers, particularly for those in rural communities</li>
              <li>Financial considerations, including work absences and travel costs</li>
              <li>Communication challenges with medical teams who may not understand cultural contexts</li>
              <li>Discomfort with discussing intimate health concerns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many hospitals now offer Māori health liaison services to help address these barriers.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Talking with Whānau About Your Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>For many Māori men, discussing prostate cancer with whānau can be challenging but important. Consider:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Choosing a trusted family member to help share information with the wider whānau</li>
              <li>Using straightforward language and explaining what Stage 1 means (early and treatable)</li>
              <li>Discussing how whānau can practically support you during treatment</li>
              <li>Encouraging male whānau members over 50 to consider their own prostate health</li>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Active Surveillance</h3>
            <p>For most Stage 1 patients in New Zealand, doctors recommend active surveillance rather than immediate treatment. This involves:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Regular PSA tests (every 3-6 months)</li>
              <li>Digital rectal exams (every 6-12 months)</li>
              <li>Repeat biopsies (usually every 1-3 years)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data from New Zealand shows that 80% of low-risk patients are managed with active surveillance, which has increased from 66% in recent years as evidence shows this approach is safe and effective.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radical Prostatectomy</h3>
            <p>Surgical removal of the entire prostate gland and some surrounding tissue. In New Zealand, this may be performed as:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Open surgery</li>
              <li>Laparoscopic surgery</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radiation Therapy</h3>
            <p>The Canterbury Regional Cancer and Haematology Service and other cancer centers in New Zealand provide radiation therapy options including:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT)</li>
              <li>Brachytherapy (internal radiation)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For low-risk prostate cancer in New Zealand, radiation therapy alone (without hormone therapy) is used in approximately 16% of cases.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold">Can I drive during treatment?</h3>
            <p>In most cases, you can drive yourself to and from treatment appointments. However, it's useful to bring someone to your first treatment appointment for support.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Should I restrict my activities or diet?</h3>
            <p>As long as you feel capable, it's OK to continue with normal activities and diet. You may become more tired than usual, so it's important to look after yourself and avoid excessive tiredness and stress.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Should I continue to take my regular medications?</h3>
            <p>Please check with your oncology team about any medications you're taking. It's helpful to bring a list of all medications to your appointments.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Can I have immunisations while receiving treatment?</h3>
            <p>It is safe to have the flu vaccine while on treatment. The shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is a live vaccine and should NOT be given while receiving treatment.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Can I visit my dentist while receiving treatment?</h3>
            <p>It's important to maintain good oral health. Ideally, any dental problems should be addressed before starting treatment. If you develop problems during treatment, you can still have dental treatment, but timing should be discussed with your oncology specialist.</p>
