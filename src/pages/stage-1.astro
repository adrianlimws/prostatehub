            <div class="space-y-4">
              <p>Stage 1 prostate cancer means the cancer is small and contained entirely within the prostate. At this stage:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>The cancer cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam</li>
                <li>The cancer is microscopic and only found through a biopsy</li>
                <li>PSA levels are usually below 10 ng/mL</li>
                <li>The Gleason score is typically 6 or lower</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Stage 1 prostate cancer is part of the "low-risk" category and has an excellent prognosis in New Zealand, with many treatment options available.</p>
              <p>In New Zealand, most Stage 1 prostate cancers are detected through PSA blood tests, followed by either transperineal or transrectal biopsies. Transperineal biopsy (where the needle passes through the skin between the scrotum and rectum) is now the preferred method in New Zealand due to lower risk of complications.</p>

            <div class="space-y-4">
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Active Surveillance</h3>
              <p>For most Stage 1 patients in New Zealand, doctors recommend active surveillance rather than immediate treatment. This involves:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Regular PSA tests (every 3-6 months)</li>
                <li>Digital rectal exams (every 6-12 months)</li>
                <li>Repeat biopsies (usually every 1-3 years)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Data from New Zealand shows that 80% of low-risk patients are managed with active surveillance, which has increased from 66% in recent years as evidence shows this approach is safe and effective.</p>
              
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radical Prostatectomy</h3>
              <p>Surgical removal of the entire prostate gland and some surrounding tissue. In New Zealand, this may be performed as:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Open surgery</li>
                <li>Laparoscopic surgery</li>
                <li>Robotic-assisted surgery (available at some hospitals)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radiation Therapy</h3>
              <p>The Canterbury Regional Cancer and Haematology Service and other cancer centers in New Zealand provide radiation therapy options including:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT)</li>
                <li>Brachytherapy (internal radiation)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For low-risk prostate cancer in New Zealand, radiation therapy alone (without hormone therapy) is used in approximately 16% of cases.</p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold">Can I drive during treatment?</h3>
              <p>In most cases, you can drive yourself to and from treatment appointments. However, it's useful to bring someone to your first treatment appointment for support.</p>
              
              <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Should I restrict my activities or diet?</h3>
              <p>As long as you feel capable, it's OK to continue with normal activities and diet. You may become more tired than usual, so it's important to look after yourself and avoid excessive tiredness and stress.</p>
              
              <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Should I continue to take my regular medications?</h3>
              <p>Please check with your oncology team about any medications you're taking. It's helpful to bring a list of all medications to your appointments.</p>
              
              <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Can I have immunisations while receiving treatment?</h3>
              <p>It is safe to have the flu vaccine while on treatment. The shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is a live vaccine and should NOT be given while receiving treatment.</p>
              
              <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Can I visit my dentist while receiving treatment?</h3>
              <p>It's important to maintain good oral health. Ideally, any dental problems should be addressed before starting treatment. If you develop problems during treatment, you can still have dental treatment, but timing should be discussed with your oncology specialist.</p>
