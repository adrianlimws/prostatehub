          <div class="space-y-4 font-serif">
            <p>Stage 4 prostate cancer means the cancer has spread beyond the prostate to distant parts of the body. At this stage:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>The cancer has metastasized to other organs, lymph nodes, or bones</li>
              <li>PSA levels are typically very elevated</li>
              <li>The Gleason score is usually 8-10</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stage 4 is further divided into:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Stage 4A:</strong> Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant organs</li>
              <li><strong>Stage 4B:</strong> Cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bones, or other organs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In New Zealand, approximately 8% of prostate cancer diagnoses are metastatic (Stage 4) at the time of diagnosis. This equates to about 350 men annually diagnosed with what doctors call "de novo" metastatic disease, meaning they are diagnosed at Stage 4 without having gone through earlier stages.</p>
            <p>While Stage 4 prostate cancer is not typically curable, many men live for years with good quality of life with proper treatment and management.</p>
          </div>

        <Accordion title="Treatment Approaches in New Zealand">
          <div class="space-y-4 font-serif">
            <p>Based on New Zealand patient data, the following treatments are commonly used for Stage 4 prostate cancer:</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Hormone Therapy (ADT)</h3>
            <p>The foundation of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, used in about 63% of metastatic cases in New Zealand. This includes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>LHRH agonists like Goserelin (Zoladex) - given as a 12-week implant in the abdomen</li>
              <li>Anti-androgens like Bicalutamide - typically taken as tablets</li>
              <li>Combined androgen blockade approaches</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Treatment is usually administered by oncology nurses at cancer centers throughout New Zealand, with implants typically given every three months.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radiation Therapy with Hormone Therapy</h3>
            <p>About 31% of metastatic patients in New Zealand receive radiation combined with hormone therapy, which can help:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Control symptoms from the primary tumor</li>
              <li>Relieve pain from bone metastases</li>
              <li>Slow disease progression</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Canterbury Regional Cancer and Haematology Service and other cancer centers in New Zealand provide radiation therapy services.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Chemotherapy</h3>
            <p>Often given alongside hormone therapy for metastatic disease:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Docetaxel (Taxotere) - usually the first chemotherapy option</li>
              <li>Given as intravenous infusions at cancer centers</li>
              <li>Typically administered in a six-cycle program over 18 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before starting chemotherapy, patients often have dental checks and other preparations to reduce potential side effects.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Bone-Targeted Therapies</h3>
            <p>To strengthen bones and prevent complications:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Bisphosphonates like zoledronic acid - given as intravenous infusions</li>
              <li>Typically administered every 12 weeks</li>
              <li>Requires drinking plenty of water before treatment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Advanced Hormone Therapies</h3>
            <p>Second-generation hormone therapies:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) - now available in New Zealand but may not be fully funded for all patients</li>
              <li>Often reserved for when standard hormone therapy is no longer effective</li>
