        <StudySection title="Studies: Kegel Exercises">
          Kegel exercises strengthen pelvic floor muscles that support bladder control and sexual function. Research shows these exercises significantly improve urinary continence following prostate surgery and may enhance erectile function. Regular practice can speed recovery after prostatectomy and provide long-term benefits for prostate health.

        <StudySection title="Studies: Kawakawa Tree">
          The New Zealand Kawakawa tree has been used in traditional MƒÅori medicine for generations. Recent scientific studies validate its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and analgesic properties. Ongoing research explores its potential benefits for metabolic health and possible anticancer effects, making it an interesting area of study for prostate health management.

        <StudySection title="Studies: K9 Medical Detection">
          K9MD trains dogs to detect prostate cancer through scent in urine samples. Clinical trials in New Zealand show detection rates comparable to conventional tests, and sometimes higher. This non-invasive approach could complement traditional diagnostic methods, potentially reducing the need for invasive procedures while improving early detection.
