                    <p>Stage 3 prostate cancer presents significant challenges for Māori men, who are often diagnosed at more advanced stages compared to non-Māori. Research from Te Aho o Te Kahu (Cancer Control Agency) indicates Māori men have a 70% higher mortality rate from prostate cancer, despite similar overall incidence rates, largely due to later diagnosis and treatment barriers.</p>

                    <p>Stage 3 prostate cancer typically requires more aggressive treatment approaches. For Māori men, maintaining cultural connections during this intensive treatment period is vital:</p>

                    <li>Creating a roster system for accompanying you to treatments and appointments</li>
                    <li>Establishing clear communication channels to keep extended whānau informed of progress</li>

                    <li>Request a Māori health navigator (kaiāwhina) through your DHB to help coordinate care</li>
