                            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> In most cases, you can drive to and from treatment appointments, but it's helpful to bring someone to your first appointment</li>
                            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> No special dietary changes are required during treatment, but maintaining good nutrition is important</li>
                            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Any amount of activity, no matter how small, can help you regain strength</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Bring a list of all medications to your appointments, including complementary medicines</li>
                            <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Maintain good oral health, but discuss timing of dental work with your oncology team</li>
