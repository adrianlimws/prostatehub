          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Benefits for Prostate Health</h3>
          <p>Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder, intestines, and sexual function. Initially developed for women, they've since proven beneficial for male pelvic health, particularly for men recovering from prostate surgery.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Clinical Benefits</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Urinary Incontinence:</strong> Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) significantly improves urinary continence in men following radical prostatectomy, with better outcomes when started early post-surgery.</li>
            <li><strong>Erectile Function:</strong> Studies show men with erectile dysfunction who performed Kegel exercises for three months reported improved erectile rigidity and control.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Prostatectomy Recovery:</strong> Men who performed Kegel exercises before and after prostate surgery showed faster recovery of urinary continence compared to those who didn't.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">How to Perform Kegel Exercises</h3>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Identify the correct muscles by trying to stop urination midstream.</li>
            <li>Contract these muscles for 3-5 seconds, then relax for an equal duration.</li>
            <li>Perform 10-15 repetitions, three times daily.</li>
            <li>Avoid engaging abdominal or gluteal muscles during the exercise.</li>
            <li>Gradually increase duration and intensity over time for best results.</li>

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Traditional Use in New Zealand</h3>
          <p>The New Zealand Kawakawa tree (Piper excelsum) has been utilized in traditional Māori medicine (rongoā Māori) for treating various ailments. Recent scientific studies have begun to validate its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and potential anticancer effects.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Key Medicinal Properties</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory Effects:</strong> Kawakawa extracts have shown significant anti-inflammatory properties, potentially through modulation of cytokine pathways.</li>
            <li><strong>Antimicrobial Activity:</strong> Studies report effectiveness against common pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus.</li>
            <li><strong>Analgesic (Pain Relief):</strong> Contains compounds such as pellitorine which demonstrate analgesic effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential Anticancer Properties:</strong> Recent research suggests certain compounds in Kawakawa may have cytotoxic effects against specific cancer cell lines.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Current Research</h3>
          <p>Ongoing research is exploring Kawakawa's potential in metabolic health, gut microbiota modulation, and chronic disease management. Clinical trials co-designed with rongoā Māori practitioners are assessing its effectiveness in reducing inflammation and improving health outcomes.</p>

      <Accordion title="K9MD Cancer Detection Dogs">
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">K9 Medical Detection in New Zealand</h3>
          <p>K9 Medical Detection (K9MD) is an innovative New Zealand program that trains dogs to detect cancer and other medical conditions through scent detection. This initiative aims to provide non-invasive, early detection methods that complement traditional diagnostic techniques.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Prostate Cancer Detection Success</h3>
          <p>Clinical trials in New Zealand have demonstrated that trained dogs can detect prostate cancer through urine samples with high sensitivity and specificity. Studies found that detection dogs identified prostate cancer cases with accuracy rates comparable to, or sometimes exceeding, conventional diagnostic methods like PSA tests.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Recent Achievements</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Dogs like Frieda (German Shepherd) have shown remarkable success in prostate cancer detection.</li>
            <li>K9MD reported further detection successes in 2023, reinforcing the effectiveness of their canine training programs.</li>
            <li>Recent funding expansions in 2025 support continued research in this field.</li>
            <li>Clinical trials are ongoing to develop non-invasive urine tests for early prostate cancer detection.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The ability of dogs to detect prostate cancer at an early stage could provide an alternative or complementary screening method, potentially reducing the need for invasive biopsies.</p>
