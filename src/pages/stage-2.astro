          <div class="space-y-4 font-serif">
            <p>Stage 2 prostate cancer means the cancer is still confined to the prostate but is larger than in Stage 1. At this stage:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>The cancer may be felt during a digital rectal exam</li>
              <li>The cancer may be visible on imaging tests</li>
              <li>PSA levels are usually between 10-20 ng/mL</li>
              <li>The Gleason score is typically 7</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stage 2 is further divided into 2A and 2B, based on how much of the prostate is affected and the Gleason score.</p>
            <p>Stage 2 is typically categorised as "intermediate-risk" prostate cancer. In New Zealand, intermediate-risk prostate cancer is the most common risk category at diagnosis, representing about 44% of all diagnoses.</p>
          </div>
        </Accordion>
        
        <Accordion title="Treatment Options in New Zealand">
          <div class="space-y-4 font-serif">
            <p>Several treatment options are available for Stage 2 prostate cancer in New Zealand, with the choice depending on factors such as your age, overall health, and personal preferences:</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Radical Prostatectomy</h3>
            <p>Surgical removal of the prostate gland is the most common treatment for Stage 2 cancer in New Zealand, with approximately 59% of intermediate-risk patients choosing this option. This can be performed through:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Open surgery</li>
              <li>Laparoscopic surgery</li>
              <li>Robotic-assisted surgery (available at some hospitals)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New Zealand data shows younger patients (under 60) are more likely to receive surgery (82% of intermediate-risk patients) compared to older patients over 75 (19%).</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radiation Therapy</h3>
            <p>Radiation therapy is used in about 16% of intermediate-risk cases in New Zealand. Options include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) - using high-energy x-rays aimed at the cancer</li>
              <li>Brachytherapy - inserting radioactive sources directly into the prostate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Older patients (over 75) are more likely to receive radiation therapy alone (25% of intermediate-risk patients) compared to younger patients under 60 (7%).</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Radiation Therapy with Hormone Therapy</h3>
            <p>Some intermediate-risk patients (about 3-8%) receive a combination of radiation therapy and hormone therapy (also called androgen deprivation therapy or ADT). This approach is more common for higher-risk cases.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Active Surveillance</h3>
            <p>For some Stage 2 patients with lower Gleason scores, active surveillance may still be an option, particularly for older men or those with other health conditions. In 2021, about 15% of intermediate-risk patients in New Zealand were managed with active surveillance.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6">Watchful Waiting</h3>
            <p>A less intensive monitoring approach called watchful waiting is used in about 4% of intermediate-risk cases, primarily in older patients or those with significant health issues.</p>
